# Key Features:

MVVM Architecture: The app is structured using the MVVM design pattern, separating the data model (Model), user interface (View), and the logic that binds them (ViewModel). This separation enhances code maintainability and testability.

UIKit: The application is built using UIKit, one of the fundamental frameworks for iOS app development. UIKit provides a set of tools and components for creating a responsive and user-friendly interface.

# Project Goals:

Education: This project aims to provide a practical example of implementing the MVVM architecture in a UIKit-based iOS application. It serves as a learning resource for developers looking to understand and adopt modern architectural patterns.

SwiftBook Community: The repository is a contribution to the SwiftBook community, offering valuable insights and code samples for those interested in iOS app development with Swift.
